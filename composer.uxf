The Composer API must support three operations: add a new composer, view a list of famous composers, and view a composer by their id.

In your flowchart, identify the "whats, hows, their input and outputs, and anticipated goals." For inspiration, using figure 2.12 as a guide.
Name the operations as: findAllComposers, findComposerById, and createComposer.</panel_attributes><additional_attributes></additional_attributes></element></diagram>
